# Claude Code Support

Branch: `13-add-support-for-claude-code`
Plan Slug: `claude-code-support`
Parent Issue: #13
Created: 2026-05-03
Status: planning

## Context

Issue #13 ("Add support for claude code") asks for an orchestrator client with
Claude Code analogous to the existing OpenCode integration. The clarification
comment from the issue owner (2026-05-03) reframes the priority: the load-bearing
problem is that the supervisor/main thread today has to remain blocked polling
`wait_for_run` per active run. There is no way for several runs to be in flight
while the supervisor returns control to the user, and no notification path so
the main thread learns that a run reached terminal/error without polling.

A subsequent product-scope decision from the human owner (2026-05-03, recorded
in Decision 18) **expands** this issue: the Claude Code harness is positioned
as the **recommended rich-feature** orchestration harness once it is ready,
because Claude Code exposes more of the primitives the orchestrator wants
(background tasks, native push, isolation flags). The OpenCode supervisor
harness **remains supported** and continues to receive compatible
improvements where feasible (notification-aware prompt, parity on shared
harness abstractions, docs covering both harnesses). The existing Codex and
Claude worker backends are unchanged. There is **no deprecation, removal
plan, runtime deprecation warning, or maintenance-only schedule for the
OpenCode supervisor in this plan**. Earlier draft language to that effect
was overstated and is explicitly retracted.

This plan covers three interleaved deliverables, sequenced **B → A → C**:

- **B. Monitor / notification core (daemon-owned, backend-agnostic).** Add
  durable notification records, request/response APIs that subscribe across
  many runs at once, and a monitor CLI that blocks against the daemon until
  the next `terminal` or `fatal_error` so a Claude Code (or any) supervisor
  can launch it as a background process and be notified by the surrounding
  harness when the background process exits.
- **A. Production-grade Claude Code supervisor harness.** A non-invasive
  launcher that wires the agent-orchestrator MCP server into the Claude Code
  CLI with a curated supervisor system prompt, **strict isolation from the
  user's Claude Code state**, an explicit permission/tool/MCP/skill
  allowlist, and a hardened CLI passthrough surface. The harness must not
  inherit user/project Claude skills, slash commands, agents, hooks, or MCP
  servers, must not use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, and must use
  `--strict-mcp-config` (or the validated equivalent) so only the
  agent-orchestrator MCP server is reachable.
- **C. OpenCode coexistence and shared-core parity.** Extract the parts of
  the harness that are not Claude-specific (worker-profile validation,
  capability catalog, supervisor prompt building blocks, monitor-pin
  resolution, deny-by-default permission scaffolding) into a shared core
  consumed by both `src/claude/` and `src/opencode/`. Update the OpenCode
  supervisor prompt to use `wait_for_any_run` and `list_run_notifications`,
  and update the docs so both harnesses are described side-by-side with
  Claude framed as the recommended rich-feature option when available.

Already in place (verified by reading the code, not assumed):

- `src/backend/claude.ts` registers a Claude Code worker backend with
  stream-json parsing, model + reasoning effort flags, and `--resume`. Treat
  this as a worker-side dependency only — it does **not** satisfy issue #13.
- `src/orchestratorService.ts` already runs workers as long-lived background
  processes with durable run state, idle/execution timeouts, activity
  tracking, latest-error metadata, and bounded `wait_for_run` (1-300 s).
- `src/opencode/{capabilities,config,launcher,skills}.ts` shows the established
  harness pattern: generate a config in memory, pass it via env to the spawned
  CLI, never write into the target workspace.
- `LRT-7` already steers the OpenCode supervisor prompt toward bounded waits
  with adaptive cadence; that complements but does not replace the new
  notification path.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Choice | Rationale | Rejected Alternatives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scope for issue #13 | Cover both monitor/notification core (B) and Claude Code supervisor harness (A) in one plan. Sequence: B before A. Implementation may land across multiple PRs. | The clarification comment makes the notification path the load-bearing deliverable; the harness depends on it. Treating ClaudeBackend as completion of #13 is explicitly rejected. | Splitting into two issues; doing only A; doing only B; treating the existing worker backend as enough. |
| 2 | Notification model | Daemon-owned, backend-agnostic durable notification records keyed by `run_id` + `notification_id`. Each terminal/error/(later) milestone state transition produces one record. Records persist across daemon restart. | Polling-only is insufficient per the comment. MCP push notifications are not a guaranteed path on every client. A daemon-owned record store is portable, request/response compatible, replayable after disconnect, and supports many concurrent runs. | Relying on MCP `notifications/*` push as the only path; in-memory-only signalling that is lost across restart; per-backend bespoke notify hooks. |
| 3 | Subscribe API shape | Add `wait_for_any_run({ run_ids[], wait_seconds, after_notification_id? })` and `list_run_notifications({ run_ids?[], since_notification_id?, limit, include_acked? })` plus `ack_run_notification({ notification_id })`. All request/response-compatible. Existing `wait_for_run` and status APIs stay. | Many supervisors only need a single multi-run blocking call. The list/ack pair makes the daemon a durable queue across client restarts and lets the supervisor reconcile runs after returning control to the user. | Adding only `wait_for_any_run`; relying on streaming MCP subscriptions; reusing `wait_for_run` with a list parameter (breaks the schema and existing 300 s ceiling per run). |
| 4 | MCP push notifications | Optional, opportunistic. The daemon may emit `notifications/run/changed` over the MCP channel when a record is appended, but the supervisor is not required to consume them. Notification records remain authoritative. | The reviewer requires that the plan not rely solely on push. Push-as-hint plus durable records is robust whether the client surfaces push or not. | Making push the primary path; omitting push entirely; gating Claude Code support on MCP push behavior. |
| 5 | Monitor CLI | Add `agent-orchestrator monitor <run_id> [--json-line] [--since <notification_id>]` that blocks against the daemon until **either a `terminal` or a `fatal_error` notification** is appended for the run. Prints exactly one JSON line on stdout (`run_id`, `status`, `kind`, `terminal_reason`, `notification_id`, `latest_error`) and exits with the documented exit-code table (see CCS-5 acceptance criteria). | This is the cleanest way to leverage Claude Code's `Bash run_in_background: true` primitive: the supervisor launches one monitor per active run and the surrounding Claude Code harness signals the main thread when the bash exits. Waking on `fatal_error` as well as `terminal` matches the comment's "terminal or error state" requirement and lets the supervisor react to fatal backend failures without waiting for the worker process to terminate. | Server-only signalling (no CLI handle); using stderr instead of a clean json-line; mixing progress lines with the terminal record; waking only on `terminal` (would delay actionable error reporting). |
| 6 | Claude is the recommended rich-feature harness; OpenCode coexists as a supported harness | Position Claude as the **recommended** orchestration harness when its richer feature set is needed (native background tasks, push notifications, strong isolation primitives). OpenCode stays a fully supported peer harness and receives compatible improvements: notification-aware supervisor prompt, parity on shared harness abstractions, dual-harness docs. There is no deprecation warning, deprecation phase, removal plan, or maintenance-only label applied to OpenCode in this plan. The OpenCode supervisor harness remains stable and supported; the existing Codex and Claude worker backends are unchanged. | Reviewer-corrected product decision (2026-05-03 retraction): the user plans to switch to Claude Code once it is ready, but explicitly wants OpenCode to remain supported and improved in parallel; no deprecation in this slice. | Deprecating OpenCode now; framing OpenCode as legacy; printing a deprecation warning; scheduling removal phases; treating OpenCode improvements as out of scope. |
| 7 | Claude Code harness isolation boundary | The supervisor runs in a **strict isolation envelope** built ephemerally per launch under the daemon-owned state dir. Concretely: (a) a generated MCP config containing **only** the agent-orchestrator MCP server is passed via `--mcp-config <ephemeral.json>` together with `--strict-mcp-config` (CCS-7a confirms the flag; see Decision 17); (b) a generated `settings.json` is passed via the validated injection mechanism (CCS-7a) and configures permissions, the tool allowlist, and the curated skill/agents/commands roots; (c) the spawned `claude` process is started with `HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` redirected to ephemeral dirs and with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (or whatever variable CCS-7a confirms) pointing into the same ephemeral root, so the user's `~/.claude/` is unreadable to the supervisor; (d) project-scoped `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`, and `.claude/hooks/` files in the target workspace are explicitly **not** loaded — confirmed by harness leak tests; (e) `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is **never** used; (f) all ephemeral files are cleaned up on exit. Do not write into the target workspace's `.claude/` or `.mcp.json`, or into the user's `~/.claude/`. | Production-grade orchestration must not silently inherit arbitrary user MCP servers, slash commands, hooks, or skills — these can leak secrets, change tool semantics, or break the orchestration contract. The reviewer specified strict isolation and no `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Ephemeral redirection of `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` makes the boundary enforceable rather than merely documented. | Inheriting user/project Claude state by default; opt-out instead of opt-in for user state; using `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; making the boundary documentation-only; mutating user/workspace config; passing only `--mcp-config` without `--strict-mcp-config`. |
| 8 | Claude Code supervisor surface | Single curated supervisor system prompt + permission/tool/MCP/skill allowlist generated by `src/claude/config.ts` and consumed by the launcher. No dependency on Claude Code's experimental sub-agent / agent-team / Task-tool behavior. Prompt teaches: profile-mode `start_run`, launching `agent-orchestrator monitor <run_id>` via `Bash run_in_background: true` (with the monitor command reaching the daemon through a known path; see Decision 23), reacting on both `terminal` and `fatal_error` wake semantics, reconciling via `wait_for_any_run` / `list_run_notifications`, bounded-wait fallback when monitors are unavailable. Tool allowlist (Decision 22) restricts which Claude Code tools the supervisor can call. | Robust on whatever Claude Code primitives are stable today. Sub-agents and agent-team behavior may be useful later but cannot be a hard dependency. | Requiring sub-agents/agent-teams; relying on Claude Code's `Task` tool semantics being stable; baking model-specific Claude Code internals into the prompt; allowing free-form tool use. |
| 9 | Persistence layout | Single daemon-owned append-only journal `notifications.jsonl` under the run-store root acts as the authoritative source of order. Each entry carries a `notification_id` that **embeds a strictly increasing daemon-global sequence number** (see Decision 13). A per-run `notifications.jsonl` file may be written as a denormalized index/optimization, but the global journal is the source of truth used for cursor reads. Acknowledgement is recorded in a sidecar `acks.jsonl` (global) so the original notification is never mutated. | Append-only matches the existing run-store style and gives durability without schema migration risk. A single global journal removes any ambiguity about cross-run ordering. | Mutating notification records in place; storing notifications inside `meta.json`; adding a SQLite dependency; using only per-run files (forces order reconstruction at read time). |
| 10 | API compatibility | All new tools and contract fields are additive. Existing tool names, response envelopes, status enums, and bounded `wait_for_run` semantics are preserved. | Reviewer specifies request/response-compatible APIs. Breaking existing clients is rejected. | Renaming or repurposing `wait_for_run`; changing status enums; replacing the existing run schema. |
| 11 | Notification trigger surface | Emit notifications on terminal status transitions (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `timed_out`, `orphaned`) and on the first appended fatal `latest_error`. Reserve schema room for future progress milestones, but do not emit progress notifications in this slice. | Matches the comment's "terminal or error state" requirement and avoids notification spam. | Emitting on every event; emitting only on success; coupling to backend-specific events. |
| 12 | Wake semantics for consumers | `wait_for_any_run`, `list_run_notifications`, and the `monitor` CLI all wake on **both** `terminal` and `fatal_error` notification kinds by default. Filter parameters (`kinds?: ('terminal' \| 'fatal_error')[]`) are accepted additively for callers that want narrower wake conditions, but the default is the union. The `monitor` CLI's exit-code table distinguishes terminal-success / terminal-failure / fatal-error / timeout / cancelled / unknown / daemon-unavailable so a Claude Code `Bash run_in_background: true` consumer can branch on the exit code without parsing JSON. | Aligns with the comment: the supervisor must learn about a fatal backend error as soon as it surfaces, not only after the worker process has fully terminated. Default-union wake avoids a class of "supervisor stuck because it only listened for terminal" bugs. | Waking only on `terminal` by default; requiring an explicit kind filter to receive fatal errors; emitting fatal errors only over the optional MCP push hint. |
| 13 | Notification id and cursor scheme | `notification_id` is `${seq.toString().padStart(20, '0')}-${ulid()}`. The 20-digit zero-padded prefix is a **persisted daemon-global monotonic sequence** stored under the run-store root (e.g. `notifications.seq` written via fsync on increment, recovered on daemon start by scanning the global journal). The ULID suffix is for human-readable uniqueness and tie-breaking. Lexicographic comparison on `notification_id` is a total order matching insertion order. `since_notification_id` cursors compare lexicographically. | Reviewer required deterministic global ordering before implementation. A persisted daemon-global counter embedded in the id makes ordering total, cheap, restart-safe, and cursor reads O(1) on the global journal. The ULID suffix preserves human readability without weakening order. | Plain ULID (only loosely monotonic, requires daemon-global state to be inferred); per-run sequence (does not order across runs); SQLite autoincrement (new dependency); timestamp-only ids (collisions, clock skew). |
| 14 | MCP push payload | Push hint payload is `{ run_id, notification_id, kind, status }` only. No full record, no error context, no diff. | Locked by reviewer answer. Keeps push cheap, makes durable journal authoritative, avoids racing the disk write. | Embedding `latest_error`; embedding the full record; mixing terminal context into the hint. |
| 15 | `wait_for_any_run` ceiling | `wait_seconds` is bounded to 1-300, mirroring `wait_for_run`. | Locked by reviewer answer. Consistent client-side timeout policy. Lifting later remains additive. | Allowing unbounded waits; using a different per-tool ceiling. |
| 16 | Monitor CLI single-run v1 | Ship `agent-orchestrator monitor <run_id>` only. A `--any <run_id>...` mode is explicitly deferred. | Locked by reviewer answer. One background bash per run matches the Claude Code primitive cleanly. | Shipping multi-run mode in v1; replacing single-run with multi-run only. |
| 17 | Quality gates and dependencies | All quality gates run via repo scripts (`pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm verify`, `node scripts/sync-ai-workspace.mjs --check`). Do not install packages or change dependency ranges without explicit user approval. | AGENTS.md rule: explicit user approval for installs. Prior plan (#10) ran into the same constraint. | Adding new dependencies opportunistically; skipping `sync-ai-workspace.mjs --check` when `.agents/` changes. |
| 18 | Scope expansion: production-grade Claude harness as the recommended rich-feature mode | This issue's harness deliverable is a **production-grade** Claude orchestration harness positioned as the recommended rich-feature option once available. It is **not** a replacement for OpenCode and does not deprecate it. The plan covers launcher, isolation, allowlists, supervisor prompt parity for orchestrate-* skills, leak-proof tests, docs that describe both harnesses side-by-side, and shared harness abstractions so Claude and OpenCode do not diverge. | Reviewer-corrected product decision (2026-05-03). The Claude harness is rich-featured; OpenCode coexists. Earlier "core only" framing is superseded; earlier "deprecate OpenCode" framing is retracted. | Treating the Claude harness as a partial peer; deferring isolation/allowlists/skills; treating OpenCode improvements as out of scope; reintroducing deprecation language. |
| 19 | OpenCode coexistence and shared-core parity | OpenCode supervisor harness is fully supported in parallel with the new Claude harness. Concrete coexistence work in this slice: (a) update `src/opencode/config.ts` supervisor prompt to use `wait_for_any_run` / `list_run_notifications` while preserving LRT-7 cadence; (b) extract harness-shared logic (worker-profile validation, capability catalog, supervisor prompt scaffolding, monitor-pin resolution, deny-by-default permission scaffolding) into a shared module consumed by both `src/claude/` and `src/opencode/` so they cannot drift; (c) update README and `docs/development/mcp-tooling.md` to describe both harnesses side-by-side, with Claude framed as recommended when its richer feature set is needed; (d) add OpenCode-side improvements that fall out of the shared core (e.g. tighter allowlist defaults) where compatible. **No** deprecation warning is emitted. **No** removal plan is scheduled. The existing Codex and Claude worker backends are unchanged. | The user explicitly wants OpenCode to remain supported and to improve in parallel; the most durable way to achieve that is to keep the surface stable, share the parts of the harness that are not Claude-specific, and update the OpenCode prompt for the new notification primitives. | Skipping OpenCode prompt update; letting Claude and OpenCode harnesses diverge; building Claude-only abstractions; emitting any deprecation warning; treating OpenCode as legacy. |
| 20 | "Dumb daemon and supervisor" principle for profiles and secrets | Worker profiles remain backend/model/settings aliases only. The daemon and the Claude supervisor must not introspect, surface, or relay arbitrary user MCP servers, secrets, environment variables, tokens, or credentials, and must not let user-provided MCP servers be reachable inside the supervisor envelope. The supervisor's only MCP server is agent-orchestrator. The MCP server itself only handles the documented tool surface and never proxies free-form user MCP calls. The launcher reads the profiles manifest only for backend/model/settings resolution. The same principle applies to the OpenCode supervisor envelope. | Reviewer requirement. Production-grade isolation depends on this invariant; relaxing it would re-introduce the leakage paths the isolation envelope is designed to prevent. | Allowing profiles to attach extra MCP servers; letting the supervisor enumerate user MCP servers; surfacing user environment variables to the supervisor prompt; proxying user MCP traffic through the agent-orchestrator MCP server. |
| 21 | CLI passthrough hardening | `agent-orchestrator claude` accepts a small allowlist of `claude` CLI flags after `--`; everything else is rejected with an actionable error. Explicitly **rejected**: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--mcp-config` (the harness sets it), `--strict-mcp-config` (always-on), `--allowed-tools`/`--disallowed-tools` (the harness sets them), `--add-dir` (would widen the file boundary), and any flag that loads additional settings or skill/command/agent roots from outside the ephemeral envelope. Allowed: prompt input, `--print`, `--output-format`, model selection that respects profile rules, and analogous read-only flags. The allowlist lives next to the launcher and is unit-tested. | Mirrors the OpenCode passthrough hardening (`validateOpenCodePassthroughArgs`) and prevents a user from accidentally (or intentionally) breaking the isolation envelope by passing flags that would re-enable user state. | Allowing arbitrary passthrough flags; allowing `--dangerously-skip-permissions` "just for development"; allowing `--add-dir`; relying on docs alone to discourage misuse. |
| 22 | Claude Code permission and tool allowlist | The generated `settings.json` denies all by default and allows: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, the agent-orchestrator MCP tools (under their MCP namespace), and `Bash` **only for the curated monitor command pattern** from Decision 23. `Edit`, `Write`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Task`, `NotebookEdit`, `TodoWrite`, generic `Bash`, and any non-orchestrate skill/command/agent calls are denied. The allowlist is generated from a single source of truth in `src/claude/config.ts` and asserted by tests. The supervisor's system prompt aligns with the allowlist (no instructions to use denied tools). | Mirrors and improves on the OpenCode permission model (`orchestrationPermission`). Production-grade isolation requires that the supervisor cannot accidentally edit files, run unrestricted bash, or call tools outside the orchestration contract. | Allowing free-form `Bash`; allowing `Edit`/`Write` for general use; allowing `Task` (which would launch sub-agents that escape the envelope); leaving the allowlist implicit. |
| 23 | Monitor command allowlist and resolution | The supervisor invokes `agent-orchestrator monitor <run_id>` exclusively via `Bash run_in_background: true` against an absolute, pinned binary path resolved at launch (the daemon CLI binary that is currently running, looked up via `process.execPath` + the package CLI script, or via the `AGENT_ORCHESTRATOR_BIN` env injected by the launcher). The Bash allowlist matches that exact command shape (positional `run_id`, optional `--json-line`, optional `--since <id>`) and rejects anything else. The supervisor prompt always passes the absolute monitor binary path. The CLI rejects unexpected flags. | Without a pinned path the supervisor could be tricked (or could drift) into spawning a different binary. Constraining the Bash allowlist to a single command shape makes the boundary enforceable and auditable. | Allowing arbitrary `Bash` and trusting the model to use the right command; resolving `agent-orchestrator` from `PATH` inside the supervisor; allowing arbitrary flags after the `run_id`. |
| 24 | Skill/command/agent strategy inside the envelope | The launcher generates an ephemeral skill root containing **only the project's `orchestrate-*` SKILL.md files** (resolved from `.agents/skills/orchestrate-*/`). No project non-orchestrate skills, slash commands, sub-agents, or hooks are exposed. The ephemeral envelope's settings explicitly disable user/project skill discovery (`enableAllProjectMcpServers: false`-equivalent and the validated skill/command/agent root overrides confirmed by CCS-7a). The supervisor's system prompt references skills by name and only by their orchestrate-* names. | Mirrors and tightens the OpenCode skill behavior (`skill: { '*': 'deny', 'orchestrate-*': 'allow' }`). User-defined skills are valuable for the user's own Claude Code work but should not bleed into the orchestration supervisor. | Inheriting all project skills by default; allowing user-level skills; allowing slash commands or sub-agents; allowing project hooks. |
| 25 | Backward compatibility | Existing CLIs, bins, MCP tool names, contract envelopes, and run-store layout remain stable. New Claude tools, contract additions, and the `agent-orchestrator claude` launcher are additive. The existing Codex and Claude worker backends both remain stable. The OpenCode supervisor harness remains stable; any improvements to it are additive (prompt content, shared-core consumption, tightened allowlist defaults that do not break existing prompts). No removal, deprecation, or breaking change is scheduled by this plan. | Reviewer requirement: preserve backward compatibility. The user wants both harnesses supported. | Removing or renaming any existing surface; renaming any stable MCP tool; changing `wait_for_run` semantics; breaking the run schema; emitting deprecation warnings. |

## Scope

### In Scope

- New backend-agnostic notification record store inside the existing
  run-store directory: a durable, append-only daemon-global journal
  (`notifications.jsonl`) that is the authoritative source of cross-run
  ordering, plus an optional per-run index for cheap filtered reads, plus a
  global sidecar `acks.jsonl`. Ordering follows the `${seq:20}-${ulid}`
  scheme from Decision 13.
- New MCP tools and contract schemas: `wait_for_any_run`,
  `list_run_notifications`, `ack_run_notification`. All additive.
- Optional MCP push hint (`notifications/run/changed`) emitted alongside record
  append; the daemon does not require client subscription for correctness.
- New CLI subcommand `agent-orchestrator monitor <run_id>` with `--json-line`
  and `--since <notification_id>` options, exit-code semantics, and a single
  json-line stdout record for the wake notification (a `terminal` **or**
  `fatal_error` record, per Decision 12).
- New `src/claude/` package: `discovery.ts`, `capabilities.ts`, `config.ts`,
  `permission.ts`, `skills.ts`, `passthrough.ts`, `launcher.ts`.
- Production-grade Claude Code supervisor harness with:
  - **Strict isolation envelope** per Decision 7: ephemeral
    `settings.json` + MCP config; `--mcp-config <ephemeral>`; always-on
    `--strict-mcp-config`; redirected `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/
    `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` so `~/.claude/` is unreadable; explicit
    non-loading of project-scoped `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`,
    `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`,
    `.claude/hooks/`; never `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; ephemeral
    files cleaned up on exit.
  - **Permission and tool allowlist** per Decision 22: deny-by-default;
    allow `Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`/agent-orchestrator MCP tools/curated
    `Bash` for the monitor command only.
  - **MCP allowlist**: only the agent-orchestrator MCP server is reachable
    inside the envelope.
  - **Skill curation** per Decision 24: ephemeral skill root containing
    only the project's `orchestrate-*` SKILL.md files.
  - **CLI passthrough hardening** per Decision 21: small explicit allowlist;
    reject `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--mcp-config`,
    `--strict-mcp-config`, `--allowed-tools`/`--disallowed-tools`,
    `--add-dir`, and any setting/skill/command/agent override flags.
  - **Pinned monitor command** per Decision 23: Bash allowlist matches
    only `<absolute-bin> monitor <run_id> [--json-line] [--since <id>]`.
  - **Curated supervisor system prompt** that teaches profile-mode
    `start_run`, monitor-via-Bash-background usage, `wait_for_any_run` /
    `list_run_notifications` reconciliation, bounded-wait fallback, and
    cancellation discipline; matches the LRT-7 cadence guidance for the
    fallback path; references only orchestrate-* skills by name.
- New CLI entry `agent-orchestrator claude [...]` and
  `agent-orchestrator-claude` bin that ships as the **recommended
  rich-feature** orchestration launcher. Spawns the `claude` CLI with the
  isolated envelope, never writes into the target workspace, cleans up temp
  files on exit. Help text and README describe both Claude and OpenCode
  launchers and recommend Claude when its richer feature set is needed.
- Claude surface discovery (CCS-7a) produces a versioned compatibility report
  covering `--mcp-config`, `--strict-mcp-config`, settings/permissions
  injection, skill/command/agent root overrides, env-based config redirection,
  and `Bash run_in_background`. Harness fails fast if the report indicates the
  isolation envelope cannot be built; the launcher does **not** silently
  downgrade to a less-isolated path.
- Leak-proof harness tests: assert that during a `claude` launch (a) no writes
  occur outside the daemon-owned ephemeral dir, (b) the user's `~/.claude/`
  is not opened/read, (c) project-scoped `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`,
  `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/hooks/`
  in the target workspace are not loaded, (d) only the agent-orchestrator MCP
  server is reachable, (e) only orchestrate-* skills are exposed, (f) the
  permission/tool allowlist matches the asserted set, (g) `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
  is never on the spawn command line, (h) the monitor command pin is
  enforced.
- OpenCode coexistence and parity work in this slice (no deprecation):
  - `src/opencode/config.ts` supervisor prompt is updated to prefer
    `wait_for_any_run` and `list_run_notifications` while preserving LRT-7
    adaptive cadence guidance. **No** background-monitor process spawning is
    added to the OpenCode harness.
  - Extract a shared harness core consumed by both `src/claude/` and
    `src/opencode/`: worker-profile validation, capability catalog,
    supervisor prompt scaffolding, monitor-pin resolution helpers,
    deny-by-default permission scaffolding. Both packages re-export only
    what they need; behavior must not regress for OpenCode users.
  - README and `docs/development/mcp-tooling.md` describe both harnesses
    side-by-side. Claude is framed as recommended when its richer feature
    set is needed; OpenCode is described as a fully supported peer with
    its own strengths.
  - orchestrate-* skill projections reference both harnesses and use
    profile-mode commands rather than locking in either launcher.
  - **No** deprecation warning, deprecation phase, removal plan, or
    maintenance-only language is shipped for OpenCode. The existing Codex
    and Claude worker backends are also unchanged.
- Updates to `src/mcpTools.ts`, README, `docs/development/mcp-tooling.md`,
  and the orchestrate-* skill projections so consumers learn the new APIs,
  the Claude Code launcher, the dual-harness side-by-side framing, and how
  to choose between Claude and OpenCode for a given workflow.
- Focused tests for everything above plus: notification store
  append/list/ack/durability across daemon restart, daemon-global ordering
  invariants, `wait_for_any_run` blocking + already-terminal short-circuit
  + fatal-error wake + cursor resume + `kinds` filter, monitor CLI exit
  codes and json-line contract, Claude launcher arg parsing, passthrough
  rejection of disallowed flags, generated permission/MCP/skill allowlists,
  shared-core regression coverage (Claude and OpenCode both consume the
  shared module without behavior drift), OpenCode prompt regression for
  LRT-7 + new `wait_for_any_run` guidance, MCP schema/tool registration.

### Out Of Scope

- Any deprecation of the OpenCode supervisor harness. No runtime warning, no
  deprecation phases, no removal plan, no maintenance-only schedule, and no
  CHANGELOG deprecation notice are shipped by this plan. (Earlier draft
  language to that effect was overstated and is explicitly retracted.)
- Any change to the existing Codex or Claude worker backends.
- Native OpenCode background-monitor process parity. The OpenCode supervisor
  prompt is updated to use `wait_for_any_run`; spawning monitor processes
  from the OpenCode harness is intentionally not added in this slice.
- Reattaching to in-flight worker processes after daemon restart.
- Streaming MCP subscriptions as the primary notification path.
- Mutating the target workspace's `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, user-level
  `~/.claude/`, or any global config.
- New Claude Code sub-agents / agent-team / Task-tool integration as a
  hard dependency. (The supervisor explicitly does not require these.)
- Live Claude Code or OpenCode model-call tests.
- Publishing, tagging, or release behavior changes.
- Cross-worktree locking or concurrent-edit prevention.
- Adding new runtime dependencies. Build-only dev dependencies are also
  out-of-scope without explicit approval.
- Allowing user MCP servers, user-level skills, project hooks, or
  non-orchestrate project skills inside the supervisor envelope (per
  Decision 7 and Decision 24).

## Risks And Edge Cases

| # | Scenario | Mitigation | Covered By |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Daemon restarts mid-run; client reconnects and asks "what happened to my runs?" | Notifications are durable on disk and `list_run_notifications({ since_notification_id })` replays everything since the cursor. Existing `orphanRunningRuns` already produces a terminal record; this slice ensures it also appends a notification. | Notification persistence test + orphan-on-restart test. |
| 2 | Two supervisors share a daemon and both ack the same notification. | Acks are advisory: the record is never mutated, ack-marker is idempotent, and listing has `include_acked` to remain visible. | Notification ack test. |
| 3 | `wait_for_any_run` is invoked with a list mixing terminal and running runs. | Return immediately with the latest terminal notification(s) for already-terminal runs; otherwise block up to `wait_seconds`. | `wait_for_any_run` unit/integration tests. |
| 4 | Monitor CLI launched against an unknown or already-terminal run. | Exit immediately with terminal record on stdout for already-terminal; non-zero exit + structured stderr for unknown run. | Monitor CLI tests. |
| 5 | Monitor CLI orphaned by Claude Code (e.g., supervisor crash). | Process is stateless; no daemon resources are tied to it. The daemon's records are independent of monitor process lifetime. | Documented in monitor CLI design. |
| 6 | Notification-record file grows unbounded across long-lived sessions. | Reuse existing `prune_runs` to also prune notifications for terminal runs older than the configured horizon. | Pruning test. |
| 7 | MCP push notification arrives before client has subscribed. | Push is a hint only; the supervisor MUST reconcile via `list_run_notifications`. Documented in tool descriptions and prompts. | Documentation review + prompt tests. |
| 8 | Claude Code launcher accidentally mutates user state. | Unit test that runs the launcher against a tempdir target and asserts no writes outside the daemon-owned temp dir; assertion that `--print-config` does not touch disk. | Harness non-invasiveness test. |
| 9 | Generated supervisor prompt drifts from MCP tool capabilities. | Prompt is built from `WorkerCapabilityCatalog` and a tool-name allowlist; harness test asserts every tool referenced by the prompt is registered in `mcpTools.ts`. | Harness regression test. |
| 10 | OpenCode supervisor changes break the LRT-7 cadence guidance. | Update prompt additively and keep regression test for the existing 30 s / 2 min / 5 min / 10-15 min cadence. | OpenCode harness test. |
| 11 | Claude Code's stream-json schema or `--mcp-config` flag changes underfoot. | Capabilities probe via `claude --version` / config-print and degrade gracefully if the harness cannot launch; print actionable error and exit non-zero. | Launcher capability/error-path tests. |
| 12 | Notification id collisions across concurrent runs. | The `${seq}-${ulid}` scheme uses a persisted daemon-global monotonic counter; tests assert strictly increasing ids across concurrent appends. | Notification id test. |
| 13 | `monitor` CLI exit code conflated with `claude` Bash exit semantics. | Document exact exit-code table and assert it in tests; the json-line stdout is the source of truth, not the exit code alone. | Monitor CLI tests + docs. |
| 14 | Reviewer-flagged scope substitutions (treating ClaudeBackend as complete; bounded-poll-only; OpenCode-only; mutating .claude/). | Each is called out in Decisions/Out Of Scope above; PR reviewers should reject any of these substitutions. | This plan + PR review. |
| 15 | Supervisor only listens for `terminal` and misses a `fatal_error` that surfaces seconds before terminal. | Default wake semantics for `wait_for_any_run` and `monitor` CLI are the union of `terminal` and `fatal_error`. Tool docs and prompts emphasize the union default. | `wait_for_any_run` and monitor CLI tests asserting fatal-error wake. |
| 16 | Daemon crash mid-write to `notifications.seq` corrupts ordering. | Counter is recovered on start by scanning the global journal for the highest embedded sequence; `notifications.seq` is a hint persisted via fsync but never the only source. | Crash-recovery test: truncate `notifications.seq`, restart daemon, assert next id strictly exceeds the highest journal id. |
| 17 | Claude Code's stable surfaces (`--mcp-config`, `--strict-mcp-config`, generated supervisor prompt/config, permission/tool allowlist, env-based config redirection, `Bash run_in_background`) differ from the harness assumptions. | CCS-7a runs an explicit discovery/validation pass against the installed `claude` binary and produces a versioned compatibility report consumed by CCS-8/9/15-19. If the only stable path requires persistent `.claude/` or `.mcp.json` mutation, the harness work is paused and the user is asked for explicit approval before deviating from Decision 7. | CCS-7a discovery report + harness fail-fast behavior. |
| 18 | User secrets or arbitrary user MCP servers leak into the supervisor envelope. | Decisions 7, 20, 22, 23, 24 enforce strict isolation: redirected `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `--strict-mcp-config`, MCP allowlist of size 1 (agent-orchestrator), tool/skill/command/agent allowlists, deny-by-default permissions, monitor-command pin, and passthrough hardening. Leak-proof tests assert each invariant. | CCS-15..CCS-19 + CCS-22 leak-proof tests. |
| 19 | Project skills/commands/hooks at the target workspace silently change supervisor behavior. | Ephemeral skill root contains only orchestrate-* SKILL.md. Settings explicitly disable user/project skill discovery for non-orchestrate paths. Tests prove non-orchestrate project skills are not exposed. | Leak-proof test (CCS-22) and skill-curation test (CCS-17). |
| 20 | A future Claude Code release silently re-enables a state path the harness does not know about. | The discovery report is versioned and stored alongside the launcher; on launch the launcher re-runs a quick verification of declared surfaces and refuses to launch if a surface drifted in a way that affects isolation. Docs include a "what to do if discovery fails" runbook. | CCS-7a + launcher fail-fast tests. |
| 21 | Claude and OpenCode harnesses drift apart, producing inconsistent supervisor behavior. | A shared harness core (CCS-21) holds worker-profile validation, capability catalog, supervisor prompt scaffolding, monitor-pin helpers, and deny-by-default permission scaffolding. Both `src/claude/` and `src/opencode/` consume it. Tests assert the shared invariants (e.g. profile-mode handling, monitor-pin resolution) hold for both harnesses. | CCS-21 shared-core extraction + regression tests for both harnesses. |
| 22 | Documentation drift makes one harness look officially "the answer" by accident. | README and `docs/development/mcp-tooling.md` describe both harnesses side-by-side, with the **recommended-when-needed** framing for Claude (Decision 6). orchestrate-* skill projections reference profile-mode commands rather than locking in either launcher. A docs review checklist enforces parity. | CCS-20 docs task + projection check. |
| 23 | Claude harness becomes the recommended rich-feature path before all orchestrate-* skills work under the curated allowlist. | CCS-16 (skill curation) and CCS-18 (allowlist) include a parity check that exercises each orchestrate-* skill end-to-end (or asserts the static skill content is consistent with the allowlist) before the Claude harness is declared ready for recommended use. | CCS-16 + CCS-18 tests. |
| 24 | Pinned monitor binary path differs across pnpm/npm install layouts (linked, hoisted, npx, global). | Launcher resolves the absolute monitor path via `process.execPath` + the package CLI script (the same package providing the daemon CLI), with a fallback to `AGENT_ORCHESTRATOR_BIN` env. Tests cover at least the local-build, pnpm-linked, and global-install layouts. | CCS-19 launcher test fixtures. |

## Implementation Tasks

| Task ID | Title | Depends On | Status | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CCS-1 | Notification record contract and store | none | pending | `src/contract.ts` adds additive schemas: `RunNotificationKindSchema = z.enum(['terminal', 'fatal_error'])`, `RunNotification` (`notification_id`, `seq`, `run_id`, `kind`, `status`, `terminal_reason`, `latest_error`, `created_at`), input schemas for `wait_for_any_run` (`{ run_ids[], wait_seconds: 1..300, after_notification_id?, kinds?: RunNotificationKind[] }`), `list_run_notifications` (`{ run_ids?, since_notification_id?, kinds?, include_acked?, limit }`), `ack_run_notification`, and response schemas. `src/runStore.ts` gains append-only `appendNotification`, `listNotifications`, `markNotificationAcked` backed by a daemon-global `notifications.jsonl` journal plus an optional per-run index. `notification_id` follows the `${seq:20}-${ulid}` scheme from Decision 13; the persisted `notifications.seq` counter is recovered from the global journal on start. Records and counter survive daemon restart, including a corrupt/missing `notifications.seq` recovery path. |
| CCS-2 | Daemon emission on terminal/error transitions | CCS-1 | pending | `OrchestratorService` and `ProcessManager` append exactly one `terminal` notification per terminal transition (`completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `timed_out`, `orphaned`) and exactly one `fatal_error` notification when a fatal `latest_error` is first surfaced (deduplicated per run). Pre-spawn failures and orphan-on-restart emit one `terminal` notification (and a `fatal_error` first if a fatal error was captured). No duplicates on idempotent terminal writes. Emission order is observable via the global sequence. |
| CCS-3 | MCP tools `wait_for_any_run`, `list_run_notifications`, `ack_run_notification` | CCS-1, CCS-2 | pending | New tools registered in `src/mcpTools.ts` and routed in `OrchestratorService.dispatch`. **Default wake semantics**: `wait_for_any_run` returns when any of the supplied `run_ids` has a `terminal` **or** `fatal_error` notification newer than `after_notification_id` (or any if cursor omitted), otherwise blocks up to `wait_seconds` (1-300). `kinds` filter is additive and defaults to `['terminal', 'fatal_error']`. Already-terminal runs short-circuit. `list_run_notifications` supports `since_notification_id` (lexicographic cursor on the global ordering), `run_ids` filter, `kinds` filter, `include_acked`, and pagination by `limit`. `ack_run_notification` is idempotent. Schemas validated end-to-end. |
| CCS-4 | Optional MCP push hint | CCS-3 | pending | When a notification is appended, the MCP server emits a `notifications/run/changed` push (or equivalent SDK hook) with the locked minimal payload `{ run_id, notification_id, kind, status }`. Supervisor behavior remains correct without subscription. Push is documented as advisory; durable journal is authoritative. |
| CCS-5 | `agent-orchestrator monitor` CLI | CCS-1, CCS-3 | pending | New CLI subcommand wired in `src/cli.ts`. Blocks via repeated `wait_for_any_run` / `list_run_notifications` against the local daemon, **waking on both `terminal` and `fatal_error` by default**. Emits exactly one JSON line on stdout for the wake record (`{ run_id, notification_id, kind, status, terminal_reason, latest_error }`). Exit-code table documented and asserted: `0` for `terminal`+`completed`, `1` for `terminal`+`failed`/`orphaned`, `2` for `terminal`+`cancelled`, `3` for `terminal`+`timed_out`, `10` for `fatal_error` (run may still be running but supervisor must react), `4` for unknown run, `5` for daemon unavailable, `6` for argument error. `--json-line` and `--since <notification_id>` supported. Single-run only in v1 (Decision 16). |
| CCS-6 | OpenCode supervisor prompt update (notification-aware, no deprecation) | CCS-3 | pending | `src/opencode/config.ts` prompt teaches `wait_for_any_run` (default-wake on terminal+fatal_error) and `list_run_notifications` for multi-run reconciliation while preserving LRT-7 adaptive cadence guidance as a fallback. Existing OpenCode harness regression tests pass; new assertions cover the new guidance. **No deprecation note is added to the prompt.** **Do not** add background-monitor process spawning to the OpenCode harness. |
| CCS-7a | Claude Code surface discovery and validation | CCS-1 | pending | New script + module (`src/claude/discovery.ts` and `scripts/probe-claude.mjs` or equivalent test) probe the installed `claude` binary and produce a structured compatibility report covering: (a) `--mcp-config <file>` accepted; (b) `--strict-mcp-config` (or the validated equivalent) accepted; (c) project-scoped MCP wiring without `.mcp.json` mutation; (d) supervisor system-prompt / config injection mechanism (CLI flag, env var, or file); (e) permission / tool allowlist behavior via `--allowed-tools` / `--disallowed-tools` and/or settings-file driven allowlists; (f) `Bash` tool with `run_in_background: true` is reliably surfaced. The report explicitly records `--dangerously-skip-permissions` as a **forbidden** surface that the harness must never emit. Report includes detected `claude --version`, presence/absence of each surface, and the recommended harness path. **Acceptance**: a fixture-backed test asserts the report shape and a documented compatibility matrix. **Escalation rule**: if the only stable path requires persistent `.claude/` or `.mcp.json` mutation, CCS-8/9 are paused and the user is asked for explicit approval before continuing. |
| CCS-7 | Claude Code capability catalog | CCS-7a | pending | `src/claude/capabilities.ts` exposes a Claude-Code-supervisor-side catalog (analogous to `src/opencode/capabilities.ts`) that re-uses backend status and worker profile validation; no duplication of OpenCode logic — extract a shared core if needed. Consumes the discovery report from CCS-7a to gate availability. |
| CCS-8 | Claude Code supervisor config builder (prompt + curated allowlist sources) | CCS-7 | pending | `src/claude/config.ts` builds an in-memory MCP config (only the agent-orchestrator MCP server) + supervisor system prompt + the inputs that CCS-15 (`permission.ts`) and CCS-16 (`skills.ts`) consume to assemble the final ephemeral `settings.json` and skill root, using only surfaces validated by CCS-7a. Prompt teaches: profile-mode `start_run`, launching `agent-orchestrator monitor <run_id>` via `Bash run_in_background: true` against the pinned monitor binary path (Decision 23), reacting on both `terminal` and `fatal_error` wake semantics, reconciling via `wait_for_any_run` / `list_run_notifications`, bounded-wait fallback that mirrors LRT-7 cadence, cancellation discipline. References only orchestrate-* skills by name. No experimental sub-agent / agent-team dependency. |
| CCS-9 | Claude Code launcher | CCS-8, CCS-15, CCS-16, CCS-17, CCS-18 | pending | `src/claude/launcher.ts` parses args (mirrors OpenCode launcher options surface where appropriate), resolves the `claude` binary, builds an ephemeral envelope under the daemon state dir containing `settings.json` (from CCS-15), `.mcp.json`-equivalent MCP config (only agent-orchestrator), curated skill root (from CCS-16), and any other surfaces required by the CCS-7a report. Spawns `claude` with: the discovery-validated MCP-config flag, **always-on `--strict-mcp-config`**, redirected `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` env, the supervisor prompt + agent identity, and the curated permission/tool allowlist. Never passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Applies passthrough hardening from CCS-17 to user-supplied flags. Cleans up the ephemeral dir on exit (including on signal). Fails fast with an actionable error if the binary's surfaces no longer match the recorded discovery report. |
| CCS-10 | CLI/bin wiring | CCS-9, CCS-5 | pending | `src/cli.ts` adds `claude` and `monitor` subcommands. `src/claudeCli.ts` mirrors `src/opencodeCli.ts`. `package.json` adds `agent-orchestrator-claude` to `bin`. Help text updated. Backward compatibility preserved: existing `agent-orchestrator`, `-daemon`, `-opencode` bins behave identically. |
| CCS-11 | Pruning extension | CCS-1, CCS-2 | pending | `prune_runs` extended (additively) to prune notifications for runs that are pruned, with a dry-run report. Dry-run still reports counts without mutation. |
| CCS-12 | Docs and skill projections | CCS-3, CCS-5, CCS-9 | pending | README, `docs/development/mcp-tooling.md`, and `src/mcpTools.ts` document the new tools, the monitor CLI exit-code contract, and the Claude Code launcher. `.agents/skills/orchestrate-*/SKILL.md` updated where relevant. `node scripts/sync-ai-workspace.mjs --check` passes. |
| CCS-13 | Focused tests | CCS-1..CCS-12 | pending | Test coverage for: notification schema/defaults including `kind` enum, run-store append/list/ack/persistence-across-restart, **daemon-global ordering invariants under concurrent appends**, **`notifications.seq` recovery from a missing or corrupt counter**, daemon emission idempotency for both `terminal` and `fatal_error`, `wait_for_any_run` blocking + already-terminal short-circuit + **fatal-error wake** + cursor resume + `kinds` filter, push-hint payload exactly equals `{run_id, notification_id, kind, status}`, monitor CLI exit codes (including the new `10` fatal-error code) + json-line + fatal-error wake before terminal, harness non-invasiveness (no writes outside daemon temp dir; `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, `~/.claude/` untouched), CCS-7a discovery report shape, generated Claude prompt assertions, OpenCode prompt regression for LRT-7 + new `wait_for_any_run` guidance, MCP tool registration, pruning of notifications. |
| CCS-14 | Verify quality gates | CCS-13, CCS-15..CCS-22 | pending | `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `node scripts/sync-ai-workspace.mjs --check`, `pnpm verify` all pass before review/PR. If `node_modules` is missing, request explicit user approval before running `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Record concrete evidence in the Execution Log. |
| CCS-15 | Claude permission/config builder | CCS-7a, CCS-8 | pending | `src/claude/permission.ts` produces an ephemeral `settings.json` (or the validated equivalent) that is deny-by-default and explicitly allows: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, the agent-orchestrator MCP tools (under their MCP namespace as confirmed by CCS-7a), and `Bash` only for the curated monitor command pattern from Decision 23 / CCS-19. Denies `Edit`, `Write`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`, `Task`, `NotebookEdit`, `TodoWrite`, generic `Bash`, all non-orchestrate skills, all slash commands, all sub-agents, all hooks. Generated content is deterministic given inputs and unit-tested against a fixture. |
| CCS-16 | Claude skill curation strategy | CCS-7a, CCS-8 | pending | `src/claude/skills.ts` resolves the project's `orchestrate-*` skills exclusively from the canonical source `.agents/skills/orchestrate-*/SKILL.md` and copies/links them into an ephemeral skill root under the daemon state dir. The launcher does **not** read `.claude/skills/` as harness input — generated `.claude/skills/orchestrate-*` projections remain `scripts/sync-ai-workspace.mjs` artifacts only. No non-orchestrate skills, slash commands, sub-agents, or hooks are exposed. The settings file disables user/project skill discovery for non-orchestrate paths (using the surface CCS-7a confirms). Tests assert: only orchestrate-* skill names are present, the source root is `.agents/skills/`, no slash commands/agents/hooks are present, ephemeral skill root is cleaned up on exit. |
| CCS-17 | Claude CLI passthrough hardening | CCS-9 | pending | `src/claude/passthrough.ts` parses tokens after `--` and validates them against a small allowlist (Decision 21). Explicitly **rejects**: `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--mcp-config`, `--strict-mcp-config`, `--allowed-tools`, `--disallowed-tools`, `--add-dir`, `--settings`, `--skill-roots` (or the validated equivalents from CCS-7a), and any flag that would point at user/project state. Allows: positional prompt input, `--print`, `--output-format`, model/profile-respecting flags, and analogous read-only flags. Errors are actionable. Unit-tested for accepted and rejected cases. |
| CCS-18 | MCP and tool allowlist enforcement | CCS-7a, CCS-15 | pending | The single source of truth for the agent-orchestrator MCP tool allowlist lives in `src/claude/config.ts` and is fed both into the supervisor system prompt and into the generated `settings.json` permission set (CCS-15). The set equals exactly the tools registered in `src/mcpTools.ts`. Tests assert: the allowlist matches `tools` exported from `mcpTools.ts`, nothing else is allowed, and the supervisor prompt does not instruct the model to call any denied tool. |
| CCS-19 | Pinned monitor command resolution and Bash allowlist | CCS-5, CCS-15 | pending | The launcher resolves the absolute monitor binary path at launch (using `process.execPath` + the package CLI script, with `AGENT_ORCHESTRATOR_BIN` env override for unusual install layouts; see Risk #24) and embeds it in the supervisor prompt and in the `Bash` allowlist as `<absolute-bin> monitor <run_id> [--json-line] [--since <id>]`. Tests cover: pnpm-linked layout, local-build layout, and global-install layout via fixtures. Other Bash invocations are denied. The CLI rejects unexpected flags. |
| CCS-20 | Dual-harness docs (Claude and OpenCode side-by-side) | CCS-9, CCS-12, CCS-21 | pending | README and `docs/development/mcp-tooling.md` describe both `agent-orchestrator claude` and `agent-orchestrator opencode` side-by-side. Claude is framed as the **recommended rich-feature** harness when its richer feature set is needed (background tasks, native push, isolation primitives); OpenCode is described as a fully supported peer with its own strengths. orchestrate-* skill projections reference profile-mode commands rather than locking in either launcher. **No deprecation notice is added to docs.** `node scripts/sync-ai-workspace.mjs --check` passes. |
| CCS-21 | Shared harness core extraction | CCS-7, CCS-8, CCS-9 | pending | New shared module (e.g. `src/harness/`) holds worker-profile validation, capability catalog, supervisor prompt scaffolding (intro/permissions language/long-running cadence), monitor-pin resolution helpers, and deny-by-default permission scaffolding. `src/claude/` and `src/opencode/` are refactored to consume it. The OpenCode supervisor prompt and config keep their existing **observable** behavior unless explicitly approved (CCS-6 is the only behavior change). Tests cover: shared-module unit tests, Claude harness still produces the expected envelope, OpenCode harness still produces the existing config (modulo CCS-6 prompt update). |
| CCS-22 | Leak-proof harness tests | CCS-9, CCS-15..CCS-19 | pending | Integration-style tests that launch the harness against a tempdir target workspace (with a poisoned `.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/skills/test-skill/SKILL.md`, `.claude/commands/test.md`, `.claude/agents/test.md`, `.claude/hooks/test.sh`, and a fake user `~/.claude/` containing a poisoned skill and MCP config) and assert that none of those poisoned surfaces are loaded. Tests assert: no writes outside the daemon ephemeral dir; the user's real `~/.claude/` is never opened/read (verified via redirected `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`); only the agent-orchestrator MCP server is reachable; only orchestrate-* skills are exposed; the spawn command line never contains `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; the spawn command line always contains `--strict-mcp-config` (or the validated equivalent); the Bash allowlist matches the pinned monitor command exactly. |

## Rule Candidates

| # | Candidate | Scope | Create After |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Supervisors should treat MCP push notifications as advisory and reconcile via durable notification records. | Daemon/MCP contract guidance for orchestrator clients. | After CCS-4 lands and is observed to be stable. |
| 2 | Supervisor harnesses must not write into the target workspace `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, or user-level config; they must use ephemeral configs under the daemon state dir. | Supervisor harness packages (`src/claude/`, `src/opencode/`). | After CCS-9 lands. |
| 3 | New backend-agnostic orchestration features must add daemon-owned support before per-backend specialization. | Cross-cutting daemon/MCP guidance. | After CCS-3 lands. |

## Quality Gates

- [ ] `pnpm build` passes (TypeScript strict; no relaxation of `tsconfig.json`).
- [ ] `pnpm test` passes (Node native test runner; targeted tests for all
  CCS-13 and CCS-15..CCS-22 items).
- [ ] `node scripts/sync-ai-workspace.mjs --check` passes whenever `.agents/`
  guidance changes.
- [ ] `pnpm verify` passes before PR (release-quality gate).
- [ ] No new runtime or dev dependencies added without explicit user approval.
- [ ] Harness non-invasiveness test asserts no writes outside the daemon-owned
  ephemeral dir during a `claude` launch.
- [ ] Leak-proof harness tests (CCS-22) pass against a poisoned tempdir
  workspace and a poisoned fake user `~/.claude/`.
- [ ] Generated permission/MCP/skill allowlists exactly match the tools
  registered in `src/mcpTools.ts` and the orchestrate-* skills present under
  `.agents/skills/`.
- [ ] The spawn command line for `claude` never contains
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and always contains the validated
  `--strict-mcp-config` (or the discovery-confirmed equivalent).
- [ ] OpenCode supervisor harness behavior is **not** broken: regression
  tests for `src/opencode/` config and prompt continue to pass; the only
  intentional change is the additive notification-aware prompt guidance
  from CCS-6. **No deprecation warning is emitted by `agent-orchestrator
  opencode` or `agent-orchestrator-opencode`** (asserted in tests).
- [ ] Shared harness core (CCS-21) is consumed by both `src/claude/` and
  `src/opencode/` without observable behavior drift for OpenCode users.
- [ ] All MCP tool descriptions in `src/mcpTools.ts` match the contract
  schemas in `src/contract.ts`.
- [ ] Relevant `.agents/rules/` checks are satisfied (`node-typescript`,
  `mcp-tool-configs`, `ai-workspace-projections`).

## Backward Compatibility And Coexistence

This plan does **not** schedule any deprecation, removal, or maintenance-only
status for the OpenCode supervisor harness. Both supervisor harnesses
(`agent-orchestrator claude`, `agent-orchestrator opencode`) ship and remain
supported. Both existing worker backends (`Backend = 'codex'`,
`Backend = 'claude'`) remain supported.

What stays stable:

- All existing CLIs and bins (`agent-orchestrator`, `agent-orchestrator-daemon`,
  `agent-orchestrator-opencode`).
- All MCP tool names, response envelopes, and contract types.
- `wait_for_run` semantics and the 1-300 s ceiling.
- Run-store layout — additions (`notifications.jsonl`, `acks.jsonl`, an
  optional per-run index) are append-only and additive.
- The OpenCode supervisor prompt remains observably equivalent except for
  the additive notification-aware guidance from CCS-6.

What is new and additive:

- `agent-orchestrator claude` / `agent-orchestrator-claude` launcher
  positioned as the **recommended rich-feature** harness when its primitives
  are needed.
- New MCP tools: `wait_for_any_run`, `list_run_notifications`,
  `ack_run_notification`.
- `agent-orchestrator monitor` CLI.
- Optional `notifications/run/changed` MCP push hint.
- Shared harness core under `src/harness/` consumed by both `src/claude/`
  and `src/opencode/`.

Coexistence invariants:

- The Claude and OpenCode harnesses share validation, capability cataloging,
  prompt scaffolding, and permission scaffolding via the shared core. They
  cannot diverge without a corresponding update to the shared module.
- Documentation describes both harnesses side-by-side. Recommending Claude
  for rich-feature flows is editorial framing, not a deprecation.
- orchestrate-* skill projections reference profile-mode commands and stay
  agnostic of the launcher.

## Open Questions

Closed by earlier reviewer feedback (recorded as locked Decisions above):

- **Wake semantics** — locked: union of `terminal` + `fatal_error`
  (Decision 12, CCS-3, CCS-5).
- **Global cursor / id scheme** — locked: `${seq:20}-${ulid}` over a
  persisted daemon-global monotonic counter; daemon-global
  `notifications.jsonl` is authoritative (Decisions 9 and 13, CCS-1).
- **Claude Code surface validation** — locked as a real task (CCS-7a).
- **Push-hint payload** — locked at `{ run_id, notification_id, kind, status }`
  (Decision 14, CCS-4).
- **`wait_for_any_run` ceiling** — locked at 300 s (Decision 15, CCS-3).
- **Monitor CLI multi-run** — deferred; v1 is single-run only
  (Decision 16, CCS-5).

Closed by the 2026-05-03 scope expansion (Decisions 18-25):

- **Claude as recommended rich-feature harness; OpenCode coexists** —
  locked (Decisions 6, 18, 19; CCS-20, CCS-21).
- **No deprecation, no removal plan, no maintenance-only language for
  OpenCode** — locked (Decision 6, Decision 19, Out Of Scope, Quality Gates;
  the earlier deprecation framing is explicitly retracted).
- **Isolation boundary** — locked: ephemeral envelope, `--strict-mcp-config`,
  agent-orchestrator-only MCP, redirected `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/
  `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, no `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, no inheritance
  of user/project Claude state (Decision 7, CCS-9, CCS-22).
- **Permission/tool allowlist** — locked (Decision 22, CCS-15, CCS-18).
- **Skill curation** — locked: orchestrate-* only, ephemeral root
  (Decision 24, CCS-16).
- **Passthrough hardening** — locked (Decision 21, CCS-17).
- **Monitor command pin** — locked (Decision 23, CCS-19).
- **Dumb daemon/supervisor for profiles and secrets** — locked
  (Decision 20).
- **Backward compatibility** — locked: no removal, no breaking changes; all
  additions are additive (Decision 25, Backward Compatibility section).

Remaining material questions (each could affect implementation; resolve
before or during the relevant CCS task, do not silently broaden scope):

1. **Exact Claude Code injection surface for `settings.json` and config
   redirection.** Discovery (CCS-7a) must confirm one of: (a) a
   `--settings <path>` (or analogous) flag, (b) a `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (or
   analogous) env var, or (c) a combination. The plan currently encodes
   redirected `HOME`/`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` as the
   load-bearing path; if CCS-7a finds none of these reliably isolate user
   state, escalate to the user before continuing CCS-9. Do **not** fall
   back to writing into the target workspace or `~/.claude/`.
2. **`--strict-mcp-config` availability.** If the installed `claude` binary
   does not support the flag (or its validated equivalent), the plan
   currently says "fail fast and ask the user." Confirm whether the user
   wants any softer behavior (e.g. warn-and-proceed when only
   `--mcp-config` is available). Default behavior in this plan: fail fast.
3. **Shared core module name and home.** The plan currently encodes
   `src/harness/` for the shared core extracted by CCS-21. Confirm this
   path or pick another (e.g. `src/supervisor/`) before CCS-21 begins so
   imports do not have to be churned later.
4. **OpenCode-side improvements that fall out of the shared core.** When
   shared invariants tighten (e.g. deny-by-default permission scaffolding
   already enforced in OpenCode today), CCS-21 may need to update the
   OpenCode prompt or config to keep behavior identical. Any change beyond
   "additive notification guidance" should be raised before landing so we
   do not silently change OpenCode user-facing behavior.
5. **Compatibility report storage.** CCS-7a produces a versioned
   compatibility report. Default in this plan: regenerate per launch
   (cheap; always matches the installed binary). Confirm before CCS-7a
   lands if a packaged-report variant would be preferred for offline
   reproducibility.
